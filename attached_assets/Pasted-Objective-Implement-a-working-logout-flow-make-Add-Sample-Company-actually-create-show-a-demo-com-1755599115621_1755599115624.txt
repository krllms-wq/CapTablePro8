Objective
Implement a working logout flow, make “Add Sample Company” actually create/show a demo company, and fix the company-creation wizard 500s. Keep stack: TypeScript, Express, Drizzle; client React + Tailwind/Headless. Return unified diff patches only.

Repo layout assumptions
- Server: server/domain/**  • DB/migrations: server/db/**  • Client: client/src/**
- Use existing auth/session middleware; don’t change authentication provider.

Tasks

A) Logout / session clear
Server
- Add endpoint: POST /api/auth/logout → destroy session + clear auth cookies → return 204.
Client
- Header avatar menu: add “Log out”. On click: `await fetch('/api/auth/logout',{method:'POST'})` → `location.href='/login'`.
- If self-service sign-up is disabled, hide any sign-up link.

B) Sample company (seed ensure)
Server
- Add idempotent endpoint: POST /api/demo/seed/ensure → if user has no `isDemo=true` company, create one; else return existing. Return { id, name, isDemo }.
- Guarantee one demo per user. Handle with transaction/unique guard.

Client
- “Add Sample Company” button calls POST /api/demo/seed/ensure; on success, **refetch companies list** (React Query invalidate) so the card appears immediately.
- Show a subtle “Sample” badge when `isDemo` is true.

C) Company creation wizard (500s)
Server
- Fix create company route handler:
  * Validate: `name` (required), `jurisdiction`/`country` (required), `incorporationDate` (required).
  * Normalize date to **date-only UTC** (YYYY-MM-DD). If picker gives only Month/Year, default day = 01.
  * On DB errors return 400 with message (not 500). On success return 201 + payload.

Client
- Wizard submit:
  * If Month/Year picker, convert to `YYYY-MM-01`.
  * Sanitize inputs, show spinner only during request; always re-enable on error; show toast.
  * On success, navigate to the company (or next step) and refetch companies.

Shared utils
- Add client `utils/date.ts`: `toDateOnlyUTC(dateish): string` and use in wizard.

Tests (add/adjust)
- Server unit/integration: logout returns 204; seed ensure idempotent; create company validates + returns 201; bad payload → 400.
- E2E: Log out → shows /login; “Add Sample Company” adds visible card instantly (no duplicates); Create Company succeeds and navigates forward.

Acceptance
- User can log out and reach login screen.
- Sample company appears immediately after clicking the button.
- Company creation no longer returns 500; dates saved as date-only in UTC.
