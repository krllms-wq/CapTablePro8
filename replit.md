# Cap Table Web Application

## Overview

This is a comprehensive capitalization table (cap table) web application designed for startups and investors to model, maintain, and share company ownership structures throughout the business lifecycle. The application supports complex equity instruments including common shares, preferred shares, options, RSUs, warrants, SAFEs, and convertible notes. Built with a modern tech stack, it provides real-time calculations, scenario modeling, and role-based access control for different stakeholder types.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Architecture
The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared components. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, while the backend uses Express.js with a Node.js runtime. The shared directory contains common schemas and types used across both frontend and backend.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for development and bundling
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management and data fetching
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling

### Database Design
The schema supports complex cap table structures with entities for:
- Companies with multi-currency and jurisdiction support
- Security classes with liquidation preferences, participation rights, and voting structures
- Stakeholders (individuals and entities) with role-based attributes
- Share ledger entries for ownership tracking
- Equity awards with vesting schedules and exercise tracking
- Convertible instruments and funding rounds
- Corporate actions and audit logging

### Authentication & Authorization
