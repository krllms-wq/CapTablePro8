# Comprehensive User Scenario Testing Results

## Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Schema Validation Inconsistencies** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Frontend sending numbers/strings but backend expecting different types
**Solution**: Enhanced schema validation with automatic type conversion
- Added string → number transformation with comma removal for all numeric fields
- Percentage conversion (discount rate from % to decimal)
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages

### 2. **Missing Foreign Key Validation** ❌ → ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: API accepting invalid stakeholder/security class IDs
**Solution**: Added pre-validation checks before database operations
- Validate stakeholder exists before creating share ledger entries
- Validate security class exists before share issuance
- Return meaningful error messages for invalid references

### 3. **Number Formatting Issues** ❌ → ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Inconsistent comma handling in number inputs across dialogs
**Solution**: Standardized number parsing across all transaction forms
- Issue Shares: quantity and consideration fields
- SAFE Agreement: principal, valuation cap, discount rate
- Grant Options: quantity and strike price
- All inputs now handle comma thousands separators correctly
